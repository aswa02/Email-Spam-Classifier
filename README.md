# Email Spam Classifier
This project is a machine learning model that can classify emails as spam or not spam. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails and uses a combination of text preprocessing and natural language processing techniques to extract features from the email text.

# Dataset :
The data set consists of over 5,000 labeled emails, with approximately 75% of the emails labeled as spam.

#Preprocessing :
Before the emails are fed into the model, they undergo a preprocessing step. This includes removing stop words, stemming, and converting all text to lowercase.
